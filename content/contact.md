<span aria-hidden="true">‚ö†Ô∏è</span> I am busy and may miss messages, but I try to reply within a week; so please be patient.
If I've missed your message after a week, please feel free to send a follow-up.

<span aria-hidden="true">üì®</span> Please feel free to send things that you think I would like, but don't add me to your mailing list. Email not personally directed at me or is generally spammy - *will* be marked as junk and won't get a response.
