title: Get Involved - Simulating the Process of Travelling from the UK

I am conducting a study on [the effects that simulating the process of travelling from the UK](/portfolio/airport-sim).

As you may know things have changed since Brexit, so if you havenâ€™t travelled before or in a long time this might be overwhelming. 

The study will consist of you being exposed to a simulation in a virtual reality headset to allow you to practise the process before you go away. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire before and after you take part.

This should take around an hour of your time, at your convenience, on the Brayford Pool campus in Lincoln or remotely if you have the necessary equipment. 

If you would like to get involved or would like more information, please contact me via my University email [25466645@students.lincoln.ac.uk](mailto:25466645@students.lincoln.ac.uk) to learn more.
