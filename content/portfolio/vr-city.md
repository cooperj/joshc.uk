This is a VR experience to simulate the effects of being in a city while being inside a VR headset. This was the first time I created anything for VR and I enjoyed doing so - so expect me to see more stuff from me!

The game was designed to run on a Meta Quest 2 and was built with the Unity Engine.

The assignment focused on discussing important things with VR experiences including; User Locomotion, Fidelity, Coherence, and the Sense of Embodiment. After discussing these, I made sure to implement them into my project.

One way I did this was by heavily expanding the world from the requirements list, and preventing the user from being able to see the edge of the map from most areas to create an immersive user experience.

This project was created at the same time in the same module as ["My Recipes" - AR Digital Recipe Book](/portfolio/my-recipes-ar), so you may be interested in checking that out too!
