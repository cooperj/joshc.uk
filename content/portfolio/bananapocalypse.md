# What is the project?

As a part of my college course, I created a game in the Unity Engine, this is the first game I have ever made to completion. This game was created as a clone of the popular mobile game, [Angry Birds](https://www.angrybirds.com/ "Angry Birds's Homepage").

The project's purpose was to create a game which can be used to promote the college, and therefore it was given some requirements which were set by the college;

- There must be a small number of levels and play, this is because the purpose is to be shown at the showcase, and the end-users arenâ€™t going to be staying at for a long period.

- Skills need to be expressed, this is because of with the showcase its main purpose is to present the skills of the individual students and the department as a whole.

- The game needs to be appropriate for the <em>wide</em> target audience, so this means that there isn't any inappropriate content, such as extreme violence, this is because this may make the audience feel uncomfortable.

# The Design

I created the design for my game, this would consist of how the game and all the different objects will look like on the mobile phone, and this includes how the game played.

## The Objects/Characters

There are 4 objects that I created: the Banana, the Super Banana, the Face Banana and the Bad Apple. The Super Banana and the Face Banana are both variants of the standard Banana. The Bad Apple is a complete opposite of the Banana, this removes points, whereas the Banana gives the user points.

<div class="row" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">

<!-- Banana -->
<div class="col-lg-3 verticalMiddle row">
<a class="centeredImage" href="/assets/images/ba2.png" data-toggle="lightbox"> <img src="/assets/images/ba2.png" alt="image of item in the game, banana" class="img-fluid"> </a>
<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Banana</figcaption>
</div>

<!-- Face Banana -->
<div class="col-lg-3 verticalMiddle row">
<a class="centeredImage" href="/assets/images/ba3.png" data-toggle="lightbox"> <img src="/assets/images/ba3.png" alt="image of item in the game, face banana" class="img-fluid"> </a>
<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Face Banana</figcaption>
</div>

<!-- Super Banana -->
<div class="col-lg-3 verticalMiddle row">
<a class="centeredImage" href="/assets/images/ba4.png" data-toggle="lightbox"> <img src="/assets/images/ba4.png" alt="image of item in the game, super banana" class="img-fluid"> </a>
<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Super Banana</figcaption>
</div>

<!-- Bad Apple -->
<div class="col-lg-3 verticalMiddle row">
<a class="centeredImage" href="/assets/images/ba5.png" data-toggle="lightbox"> <img src="/assets/images/ba5.png" alt="image of item in the game, bad apple" class="img-fluid"> </a>
<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Bad Apple</figcaption>
</div>

</div>

The Super Banana is an enhanced variant of the standard Banana, this gives the user 10 times the number of points, compared to the standard Banana, which only gives a single point. Similarly, the Face Banana is a modification of the standard Banana, however, it only gives the user a single point, it is purely a design change, this was requested by the client during negotiations.

# The Finished Project

<a class="centeredImage" href="/assets/images/ba6.png" data-toggle="lightbox"> <img alt="game being played on an iphone" src="/assets/images/ba6.png" class="img-fluid"> </a>

After creating the game, myself and beta testers have discovered things that were less than pleasant after the game finished its development.

Firstly, I thought that the graphics do not look as good in the final version compared to the mockups. This was done so that the users' experience (UX) was improved, this did make an negative impact on the User Interface (UI).

Secondly, from the user feedback, they suggested that I should add a line, this would be projected to show the user where the banana will land, this would make the game easier to play.

The game also worked correctly as it was deployed to an iPhone for the demonstration and testing.
