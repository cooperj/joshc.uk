## What is the project?

As a part of my Level 3 course, I created a pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript website for the company Contineo. They wanted a website that would be used to create a brand for Contineo.

They wanted a professional-looking interactive website, which allows them to concisely show the visitor the information about their company and what services they provide.

This was done from creating multiple pages;

- Homepage
- Services (Web Hosting, Online Server & Networking Solutions),
- Contact,
- Join our Team,
- & Frequently Asked Questions.

## What was required?

The requirements can be broken down into four sections; Branding, Content, Interactivity and Accessibility.

**Branding** was completed by creating a logo and styling the website with the fonts and colours that the company has used in the past.

They wanted **content** which included a home page, a services page, a contact us page, a join our team page, and a Frequently Asked Questions page.

The website wanted **interactive** features, such as; Fading buttons, Hidden content, Picture Slideshow, and Google Maps. These will be done using JavaScript. The site is also responsive, this means that it looks correct on a mobile device as the sizes of elements change based on the size of the screen.

The website also had to be **accessible**, this included using colours which are friendly to people with colour blindness or dyslexia, this is done by using contrasting colours.

The images had to include alt text, this is used by a screen reader to describe the image.

The website had to work on multiple browsers, so I tested that the site worked in **Google Chrome** and **Mozilla Firefox**, this ensures that the code is correct and that there is not going to be any issues.
