## What things have I been doing?

I've returned back for my third and final year of Uni, and I'm currently spending my time working with VR!

## What am I doing right now?

I'm currently working on my design skills with things such as Blender, and making stuff that's really nice to use.

I'm also really busy working on my dissertation - which is a serious game to allow people to experience the process of international travel to aid with things such as anxiety. More details will be available soon.
