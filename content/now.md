## What things have I been doing?

I've recently been working on a group project to create [Aquanaut](/portfolio/aquanaut) for University. 


## What am I doing right now?

I am currently on summer break from University.

I'm spending this time to; add more content to this website, over-engineer my home network, and test some other ideas out.

After I've got my network setup, and working reliably - I'm planning on setting up ipv6 access.

I'm also working on my Blender skills.
