Hi! I'm Josh. I'm a **multidisciplined software developer** with a focus on **games technologies**. I help ideas come alive!

I'm in my final year of my [**B.Sc. in Games Computing at Lincoln**](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/course/cgpcmpub/) *(views are my own)*, And I spend my days dealing with a range of different technologies for things such as *games development*, *general programming*, *web development*, *automation*, *networking*, and *cloud computing* - for either University, Freelancing, or Personally.

I am looking to provide my skills to create things that are interesting within a team of like-minded, passionate people.

<br/>

*On the flip side* - I spend my free-time using my skills for good by contributing to [Open-Source projects](https://github.com/cooperj).

And, in May 2022, I earned my **Foundation Radio Licence** and possess the call-sign [M7JCO](https://www.qrz.com/db/m7jco)!

I've created a bunch of different projects in my [portfolio](/portfolio) which I would recommend you reading, and I also write in my [blog](/blog).

<br/>

Not only that, but I'm [**currently available for hire**](/freelance) (employment or freelance) - this is depending on your needs.
