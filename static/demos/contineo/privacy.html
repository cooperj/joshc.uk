        <p>All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations. So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then? That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think
            I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you. Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use
            a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
        </p>

        <p>General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and
            I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered
            to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.</p>

        <p>The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick ÛŸup anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've
            got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
            We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.</p>

        <p>Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it. I call it luck. In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. Looks like we're coming
            up on Alderaan. You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.</p>

        <p>What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on
            your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you.</p>

        <p>Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here. Well, let's get moving! Where are you going? No,
            wait. They'll hear! Come here, you big coward! Chewie! Come here! Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders
            from one person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this.</p>

        <p>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
            My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that,
            that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!
        </p>

        <p>They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came
            from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this
            is Red Leader.</p>

        <p>He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one
            of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can...</p>
