This is an implementation of the core mechanics from [Overcooked](https://www.team17.com/games/overcooked/) implemented in SDL and C++.

<YouTubeEmbed videoId={"x8vDYn_1wwc"} />

This project was mainly targetted at improving my skills with C++ and to learn about the SDL graphics library compared to other engines like Unity. This was set as a University assignment and has since been picked up, sanitized and improved[^1].

[^1]: Updated February 2023, and originally completed in May 2022, changes since original submission and the version here [have been tracked via Git Commits](https://github.com/cooperj/undercooked-game/commits/main).

## Download

This game has been built for [Windows](). And, the [source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/cooperj/undercooked-game).
