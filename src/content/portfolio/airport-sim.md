This is my third year dissertation project for my bachelors degree in [Games Computing](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/course/cgpcmpub/), I am creating a [serious game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game).

The research title is currently:

> Simulating the Affects of International Travel in a Virtual World to Provide Training and Reassurance

I am using a Meta Quest headset and the Unity engine to create a simulated experience of airport travel. This can be a very anxiety inducing experience, but my experience plans to create a generic experience that will allow people to go through and either review their skills or to learn them.

This will then be useful to allow the user to have a reduced effect of anxiety symptoms.

## The Plan

The plan is to create four key phases with three tasks each. 

![A flow chart showing four logical phases. The first phase shows booking, shopping, and travelling to the airport. The next phase shows the check-in desk, the security screening, and border control. The third phase shows, duty free, finding the desired gate, and at the gate. The final phase includes travelling to the plane, boarding the plane and being on the plane.](/images/airport-sim/level-flow.webp)


## Future

Because this project is a work in progress - If you would like to receive progress updates, please get in [contact with me via email](/contact). The project will be completed around May 2023. This will then be finally completed near results time: with me potentially being able to release a version here in the meanwhile.

After this - It is expected that I will be done with University completely, and will be able to work on more [freelance](/freelance), and employed projects. If you have anything that would be of interest or would just like to follow my journey, [do get in contact with me or follow my socials](/contact). üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
