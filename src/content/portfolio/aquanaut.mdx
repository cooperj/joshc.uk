## My Role

For the project, I was responsible for managing the team to ensure we met the deadline while also creating a high quality product.

This involved me both writing code and organizing/helping others.

The most important lesson I learned from this project; is to identify who will and will not put in the necessary work.
This surfaced due to the fact the groups we're randomly assigned based on a selected category.

Once I had noticed that - I then put the necessary measures to ensure the project would continue, this included simplifying the scope and reassigning tasks.

These things happen. But, knowing when to detect these things is an important thing to have experience.

## The "finished" project

We plan to use, adapt, and steal from the project. We don't see the project as finished, so this page will be updated when we make changes.

Not only that, but we made the project Open Source! You can find the code on [GitHub ðŸ¤–](https://github.com/CMP2804M-TSE-Group-28/supernova).
