For my final year dissertation project for my bachelors degree in [Games Computing](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/course/cgpcmpub/), I created a [serious game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game). I made use of a Meta Quest 2 VR headset and a game I created with Unity engine, to create a simulated world to allow a person to simulate the effects of international travel to provide training and reassurance. The goal was to create an immersive experience that would help users prepare for the challenges they may face when travelling abroad.
