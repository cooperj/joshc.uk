So if you didn't know already <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> is - it's the ~~new~~ [old](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/explore-ipv6-with-windows-xp/) standard to replace <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr>.

My ISP doesn't _yet_ provide me with <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> in the UK, but a bunch are slowly rolling it out, especially with mobile carriers. So it is a nice thing to understand now - before it is required.

Before being able to work with <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> I need to ensure I can connect with it.

## Mobile Data

Hey! This is easy - my phone plan gives me <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> access - this one has been done for me.

And, it works invisibly - perfect!

## VPS

I have a <abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr> that runs some services for me in the <abbr title="Someone else's computer">cloud</abbr> - it would be nice to have access for

![IPv6 Address for eth0](/images/hello-ipv6/vps-ip.webp)

Ok, just had to configure my DNS to include an `AAAA` record for the severs IP and not just an `A` record. And now it works! ðŸŽ‰

## Home

Ah - there's no support. So what I did to get around this was go to [Hurricane Electric's Tunnel Broker Service](https://tunnelbroker.net/), and sign up for an account. I then configured this on my home's pfSense router.

And then to test it was working fully working before transitioning the whole network - and mainly to avoid my house mates getting annoyed - I limited the connectivity down to its own <abbr title="Virtual Local Area Network">VLAN</abbr> so I could test it safely.

So what I did was create the network without any IPv4 to test it on a per-device basis... The first device I tested was my Nintendo Switch. It didn't support IPv6.

This is not surprising, but is still upsetting; and [a comment posted to Reddit 6 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipv6/comments/5w70gs/comment/de7sm8e/) said something on the lines of "I'd be surprised if they know how to traverse a firewall"... oh, we know now.

They actually [ask in their documentation](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Set-Up-a-Router-s-Port-Forwarding-for-a-Nintendo-Switch-Console-1498000.html) to open all the ports from `1024` to `65535` ðŸ˜³

So after doing this, only half of the internet works... Mastodon, Google and this site and my connection to my VPS work, so it's perfect and it is everyone else's fault. ðŸ˜…

I asked this on Twitter (and Mastodon) and was replied to by David, and they suggested that I should configure [NAT64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT64).

And also, when I'm going via HE.net's Tunnel Broker, there are a few problems; but it's IPv6!

The two biggest ones are the connection speed is slow, and my IP location is in the States (even though I'm popping out in London?)

I was suggested to try Route48 - that will be a next step.

But for now, I have a `/48` which is broken up for all my smaller networks, and I can just turn the v6 WAN interface on and off depending on if I/we want to use dual stack (v6 and v4).

Sadly, it is _unlikely_ that my home's internet will get <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> for a while, and it may never get it.

This is because it requires extra thought to provide v6 service, compared to v4 - which has been standard and expected for [too long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion) but still works, and there's been enough bodges over the years with things such as [CGNAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT) that for most people - there's no difference.

## Certification

Another service that Hurricane Electric do is provide <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> Certification - it's probably nothing super special, but I managed to complete the way up to `Explorer` without spinning up a temporary server, so that will be the next step!

## Next Steps

So, my next steps are:

- To, complete my HE <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> Certification
- configure [NAT64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT64) routing for my v6 only network.
- Migrate to Route48 _?_
