If you want to get in touch with me, I'm available in most places. However, I do ask you that if you want a guaranteed/longer response please send that as an email.

<InfoBox>
<span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ¤¯</span> I am busy and may miss messages, but I try to
reply within a week; so please be patient. If I've missed your message after a
week, please feel free to send a follow-up.

     <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ¥«</span> Please feel free to send things that you think
    I would like, but don't add me to your mailing list. Email not personally directed
    at me or is generally spammy - <em>will</em> be marked as junk and won't get
    a response.
