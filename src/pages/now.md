## What things have I been doing?

I've returned back for my third and final year of Uni, and I'm currently spending my time working with VR!

I have also been working on [setting up IPv6](/blog/hello-ipv6) for my homes internet connection using a tunnel broker service - things didn't go exactly to plan ðŸ™„

## What am I doing right now?

I'm currently working on my design skills with things such as Blender, and making stuff that's really nice to use.

I'm also really busy working on my dissertation - which is a serious game to allow people to experience the process of international travel to aid with things such as anxiety. More details will be available soon.
